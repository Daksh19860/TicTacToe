# Tic Tac Toe Game

A simple console-based Tic Tac Toe game built in Java.

## How to Play

1. Player 1 chooses their letter (X or O).
2. Players take turns entering their moves as row and column indices (e.g., `0 0` for the top-left corner).
3. The game checks for valid moves, updates the board, and declares a winner when a player gets three in a row.
